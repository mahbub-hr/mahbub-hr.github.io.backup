Traditionally blood cells are counted manually using haemocytometer along with other laboratory equipment’s and chemical compounds, which is a time-consuming and tedious task. In this work, the authors present a machine learning approach for automatic identification and counting of three types of blood cells using Mask-RCNN image classification algorithm. Mask-RCNN framework has been trained with BCCD Dataset of blood smear images to automatically identify red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\n ","date":1608556546,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608556546,"objectID":"7bdd73dad1ee7b6dfc2ee495db3aa7f5","permalink":"https://mahbub-hr.github.io/project/blood-cell-detection-from-image-using-mask-rcnn/","publishdate":"2020-12-21T13:15:46.151Z","relpermalink":"/project/blood-cell-detection-from-image-using-mask-rcnn/","section":"project","summary":"A complete blood cell count is an important test in medical diagnosis to evaluate overall health condition.
