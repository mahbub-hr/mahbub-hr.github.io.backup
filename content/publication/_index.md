In this thesis, I have been working on blockchain storage reduction where I proposed a novel method, “SliveredChain”, to reduce storage requirement by 90% in a private blockchain system. I validated the security of the blockchain using pbft protocol, and the result have been submitted to IEEE 41st Int. Conf. Distributed Computing Sys. (ICDCS 2021), Washington DC, USA (under review).
